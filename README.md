🤖 Machine Learning:
Systems learn from data for predictions without explicit programming.

📚 Supervised Machine Learning:
Models trained on labeled data for predictions or classifications.

🔋 Regression:
Predicting continuous outcomes like house prices based on features.

📊 Example: Predicting stock prices from historical data.

🎯 Classification:
Assigning labels to inputs based on features.

🔍 Example: Classifying emails as spam or non-spam.

♎ Python Libraries:
📊 Pandas: Data manipulation.
➕ NumPy: Mathematical computing.
📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization.
🗺️ Geopandas & Shapely: Geospatial data.
📊 Plotly: Interactive visualization.
📍 Geopy: Geo distances.
📅 DateTime Conversion: Handling dates.

🔢 Data Preprocessing:
train_test_split, StandardScaler: Splitting data & scaling features.

➡️ Dataset Operations:
train_test_split, SMOTE, StandardScaler: Data manipulation.

📈 Regression Models:
Various algorithms for predicting relationships between variables.

📈 LinearRegression: Fits straight line to data.
🔍 Lasso: Selects important features.
🏞️ Ridge: Reduces model complexity.
🤝 KNeighborsRegressor: Predicts based on neighbors.
🌳 XGBRegressor: Boosts prediction accuracy.
🌲 RandomForestRegressor: Robust against overfitting.

❌ Metrics for evaluating model performance:

Explained Variance Score: 📊 Proportion of variance explained by the model; good value closer to 1.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 🔍 Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values; lower is better.

R-squared (R2): 📈 Proportion of variance explained by the model; good value closer to 1.

🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning:
Tool for finding best parameters.

🔢 Data Evaluation:
Cross-validation technique for dataset performance.

💾 Model Saving:
Saving and loading models.

⚠️ Warnings:
Managing and suppressing warnings.
